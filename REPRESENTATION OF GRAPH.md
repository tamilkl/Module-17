# Experiment 11(a): Representation of Graph

## Aim
To write a Python program to generate a graph for a given fixed degree sequence.

---

## Algorithm

1. **Start the program**:
   - Read the degree sequence from the user input.
   - The degree sequence represents the number of edges connected to each vertex in the graph.
   
2. **Define the graph representation**:
   - Create an adjacency matrix to represent the graph. The matrix will be a square matrix where each element `mat[i][j]` is `1` if there's an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`, and `0` otherwise.

3. **Construct the graph**:
   - Loop through all pairs of vertices (`i`, `j`).
   - If both vertices `i` and `j` have remaining degrees greater than `0`, decrement their degree and add an edge between them in the matrix.

4. **Display the adjacency matrix**:
   - Print the adjacency matrix in a human-readable format.
   
5. **End the program**:
   - The graph is now represented by the adjacency matrix, and the program prints the matrix.

## Program

```
def printMat(degseq, n):
	
	# n is number of vertices
	mat = [[0] * n for i in range(n)]

	for i in range(n):
		for j in range(i + 1, n):

			# For each pair of vertex decrement
			# the degree of both vertex.
			if (degseq[i] >0 and degseq[j] > 0):
				degseq[i] -= 1
				degseq[j] -= 1
				mat[i][j] = 1
				mat[j][i] = 1

	# Print the result in specified form
	print("      ", end ="")
	for i in range(n):
		print(" ", "(", i, ")", end ="")
	print()
	print()
	for i in range(n):
		print("  ", "(", i, ")", end = " ")
		for  j in range(n):
			print("  ", mat[i][j], end = " ")
		print()

# Driver Code
degseq=[]
for i in range(0, 5):
    ele = int(input())
  
    degseq.append(ele)
#degseq =[v0,v1,v2,v3,v4]

n = len(degseq)
printMat(degseq, n)

```
