# Experiment 11(c): DFS Traversal

## Aim
To write a Python program to print DFS (Depth-First Search) traversal from a given source vertex in a graph.

---

## Algorithm

1. **Start the program**:
   - Create a graph using an adjacency list representation.
   - Add edges between vertices using the `addEdge()` function.

2. **Implement the DFSUtil function**:
   - This function will recursively visit and print each unvisited vertex.
   - Mark the current vertex as visited.
   - Recursively call `DFSUtil()` for each unvisited adjacent vertex.

3. **DFS function**:
   - Initialize an empty set to keep track of visited vertices.
   - Call the `DFSUtil()` function starting from the given vertex.

4. **Input**:
   - The user provides the starting vertex for the DFS traversal.

5. **Perform DFS traversal**:
   - Start from the given source vertex and traverse all reachable vertices using DFS.
   - Print the vertices in the DFS order.

6. **End the program**:
   - The program outputs the order of vertices visited during the DFS traversal.
